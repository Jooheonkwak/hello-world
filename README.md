# hello-world
My name is Joo Heon Kwak. Today is May 11, 2016. Thanks, GitHub, this is my first github repository. I was studying the Steve Losh's 'Learn Vim the Hard Way' where I learned about the Git and GitHub. The verson control system is new to me. I think I like it very much along with the Vim text editor.
My mistake: the readme-edits the feature branch file off master branch was briefly successful, but I carelessly edited the master branch readme file today. Tried to delete the original readme-edits file. Its content: "My name is Joo Heon Kwak.  Today is May 11, 2016.  Thanks, GitHub, this is my first repository free not yet private but public.  Here, I am practicing making some commit changes (Step 3 of the Hello-world GitHub)."  4 lines 255 Bytes....I took the liberty to delete and tried to create a new branch instead to start over, named 'readme-edits05112016', off master branch. Thereby proceeded Step 3 Make and commit Changes, making some edits adding this 'My mistake' appending here.
